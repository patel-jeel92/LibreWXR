# LibreWXR

A self-hostable, drop-in replacement for the [Rain Viewer](https://www.rainviewer.com/) API. LibreWXR serves weather radar tiles using freely available radar composite data from multiple sources, with full compatibility for any client built against the Rain Viewer v2 API.

## Why?

Rain Viewer recently (as of January 1st, 2026) restricted their free API tier: maximum zoom 7, single color scheme, no satellite, no forecast, PNG only. LibreWXR restores the full pre-restriction functionality as a self-hosted service.

Beyond this though, is the goal of creating a far more customizable API backend for self hosters. The ability to specify regions, radar styles, denoising levels, and more to come as well. With the goal being self-hosting, there are far greater possibilities for what can be both ingested and output via the API, and there is no need to offer any limitations on what is provided, aside from the technicality of the implementation of such features.

## Features

- **Rain Viewer v2 API compatible** — drop-in replacement, no client changes needed
- **All 9 color schemes** — Black & White, Rainviewer Original, Universal Blue, TITAN, TWC, Meteored, NEXRAD III, Rainbow, Dark Sky, plus raw grayscale
- **Tile sizes** — 256px and 512px
- **Image formats** — PNG and WebP (with configurable lossy/lossless quality)
- **Smoothing** — zoom-adaptive Gaussian blur with seamless tile boundaries
- **Multi-region coverage** — US (CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam) via NOAA MRMS quality-controlled mosaics with IEM fallback, Europe (OPERA pan-European composite, ~155 radars across 24 countries), and Canada (MSC GeoMet with MRMS blending)
- **ECMWF IFS global fallback** — ECMWF IFS 9km precipitation data fills in worldwide coverage where no radar composite exists (~3x higher resolution than previous GFS fallback), with multi-timestep animation that auto-scales to match radar history length
- **Optical flow interpolation** — hourly ECMWF IFS frames are interpolated to 10-minute steps using dense motion vectors, so global fallback areas animate smoothly like real radar data instead of jumping hour-to-hour (configurable, enabled by default)
- **Precipitation nowcasting (experimental)** — 60-minute short-range forecast by extrapolating recent radar forward using optical flow, with configurable blend mode: pure radar extrapolation (default, closest to Rain Viewer), smooth radar-to-IFS blending, or pure IFS forecast. Beyond 60 minutes, always uses IFS. Quality varies by weather pattern — works best for steady, organized precipitation; less reliable for fast-developing convection
- **Precipitation motion arrows** — optional Dark Sky-style arrows showing storm movement direction and speed, derived from optical flow. Available for both radar and ECMWF data globally. Supports light and dark styles for different map themes via `?arrows=light` or `?arrows=dark` query parameter
- **IFS-derived satellite imagery** — global cloud cover tiles composited from ECMWF IFS high/mid/low cloud layers, approximating infrared satellite imagery. Up to 12 hours of hourly animation with persistent disk caching for instant restarts. Populates the Rain Viewer-compatible `satellite.infrared` endpoint
- **Snow detection** — per-pixel snow/rain classification using ECMWF IFS snowfall data
- **Noise filtering** — configurable dBZ noise floor and speckle removal
- **Tile cache warming** — background pre-rendering for smooth animation playback
- **Persistent disk cache** — satellite cloud grids are cached to disk with atomic writes, surviving restarts and container recreation without re-downloading from S3. Configurable via `LIBREWXR_CACHE_DIR`
- **Memory-efficient storage** — radar frames, ECMWF grids, and nowcast data are backed by memory-mapped files, letting the OS page cache manage physical RAM instead of pinning ~1 GB on the heap. Pages are reclaimed under memory pressure and re-faulted on access
- **Smart fetch optimization** — radar sources skip re-downloading frames already in memory (only ~1 of 12 frames is new each cycle), and ECMWF IFS skips redundant S3 fetches when the model run hasn't changed (IFS updates every 6 hours, checks happen every 10 minutes)
- **Health endpoint** — `/health` for monitoring uptime, per-component memory breakdown, frame count, and cache status
- **Fully configurable** — all tunable parameters exposed via environment variables

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoshuaKimsey/LibreWXR.git
cd LibreWXR
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to taste
docker compose up -d
```

### Manual

Requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoshuaKimsey/LibreWXR.git
cd LibreWXR
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to taste
python -m librewxr.main
```

The server starts at `http://localhost:8080` by default. It will fetch radar data on startup (takes a few seconds), then begin serving tiles.

### Auto-updating a Docker deployment

`scripts/auto-update.sh` is an optional helper for self-hosters running LibreWXR from a git checkout with `docker compose`. When run, it:

1. Fetches `origin` and checks whether the tracked branch has new commits.
2. If so, fast-forwards the working tree and runs `docker compose up -d --build` to rebuild and redeploy.
3. Otherwise exits quietly — it's safe to schedule via cron or a systemd timer.

The script is a **no-op by default** on any host. To opt in on a production host:

```bash
touch /path/to/LibreWXR/.auto-update-enabled
```

(Or export `LIBREWXR_AUTO_UPDATE=1` in the environment.) This sentinel is in `.gitignore`, so cloning the repo on a development machine will *not* accidentally enable auto-updates.

A typical cron entry for hourly updates:

```cron
0 * * * * /path/to/LibreWXR/scripts/auto-update.sh >> /var/log/librewxr-update.log 2>&1
```

Use `scripts/auto-update.sh --dry-run` to see what the script would do without making any changes; dry-run is always allowed regardless of the sentinel.

## Usage

### As a Rain Viewer replacement

Point any Rain Viewer-compatible client at your LibreWXR instance. The only change needed is replacing the Rain Viewer host URL with your LibreWXR URL.

For example, in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Before (Rain Viewer)
const apiUrl = "https://tilecache.rainviewer.com";

// After (LibreWXR)
const apiUrl = "http://localhost:8080";
```

**Radar regions:**

| Code | Region | Source | Resolution | RAM per frame |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `USCOMP` | Continental US | NCEP MRMS (IEM fallback) | 0.005° (~500m) | ~63 MB |
| `AKCOMP` | Alaska | NCEP MRMS (IEM fallback) | 0.01° (~1km) | ~6 MB |
| `HICOMP` | Hawaii | NCEP MRMS (IEM fallback) | 0.005° (~500m) | ~3.4 MB |
| `PRCOMP` | Puerto Rico | NCEP MRMS (IEM fallback) | 0.01° (~1km) | ~1 MB |
| `GUCOMP` | Guam | NCEP MRMS (IEM fallback) | 0.0085° (~850m) | ~1 MB |
| `CACOMP` | Canada | MSC GeoMet (MRMS blending) | 0.025° (~2.5km) | ~6 MB |
| `OPERA` | Europe (24 countries) | EUMETNET OPERA | 1km | ~16 MB |

Group aliases: `CONUS` (continental US only), `US` (all US regions), `CANADA` (Canada), `EUROPE` (OPERA pan-European composite), `ALL` (everything).
You can also mix groups and individual regions: `CONUS,EUROPE,CANADA`.

Examples:
```bash
LIBREWXR_ENABLED_REGIONS=CONUS          # just continental US
LIBREWXR_ENABLED_REGIONS=US             # all US regions
LIBREWXR_ENABLED_REGIONS=EUROPE         # Europe only (OPERA composite)
LIBREWXR_ENABLED_REGIONS=CANADA         # Canada only
LIBREWXR_ENABLED_REGIONS=CONUS,EUROPE   # continental US + Europe
LIBREWXR_ENABLED_REGIONS=ALL            # everything available (default)
```

**RAM requirements:**

Each worker process holds its own copy of all radar frames, coordinate caches, and tile caches. RAM usage grows significantly under real traffic as caches fill up.

| Configuration | Estimated RAM Needed |
|---|---|
| CONUS, 1 worker, 12 frames | ~3 GB |
| CONUS, 1 worker, 20 frames | ~4 GB |
| ALL regions, 1 worker, 12 frames | ~7 GB |
| ALL regions, 1 worker, 20 frames | ~8 GB |
| ALL regions, 2 workers, 12 frames | ~12 GB |
| ALL regions, 2 workers, 20 frames | ~14 GB |

See `.env.example` for detailed descriptions and tuning guidance for each setting.

### Scaling

| Users | Workers | RAM (ALL regions) | RAM (CONUS only) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-5 (personal) | 1 | ~7 GB | ~3 GB |
| 5-50 (small community) | 2 | ~12 GB | ~5 GB |
| 50-200 (medium) | 4 with CDN | ~22 GB | ~9 GB |
| 200+ (large) | 8+ with CDN | 40+ GB | 16+ GB |

Tiles are served with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300`, so any caching reverse proxy (nginx, Cloudflare, etc.) will work out of the box for high-traffic deployments. A CDN like Cloudflare (free tier works) absorbs most tile requests at the edge, meaning a single worker can serve far more users than the table above suggests. Using a Cloudflare Tunnel also provides free HTTPS with no certificate management. For most self-hosting scenarios, 1 worker behind Cloudflare is sufficient.

## Architecture

```
[NCEP MRMS Fetcher]        --> [Frame Store (memmap)] --> [FastAPI + Tile Renderer]
[IEM NEXRAD Fetcher]       -->  (N frames, multi-region)    (LRU cache + tile warmer)
[MSC Canada WMS Fetcher]   -->    (smart skip: only new frames fetched)
[OPERA S3 Fetcher]         -->

[Open-Meteo S3] --> [ECMWF Grid (memmap)]  --> [Optical Flow Interpolation] --> [Snow/rain classification]
  (ref_time skip)   (IFS 9km)               (hourly → 10-min frames)      --> [Global fallback]

[Latest 2 Radar Frames] --> [Optical Flow Nowcast] --> [Nowcast Store (memmap)] --> [Blended with IFS]
                            (extrapolate forward)      (6 frames, 60 min)         (spatial feathering)

[Open-Meteo S3] --> [Cloud Grid] --> [Disk Cache] --> [Satellite Tile Renderer]
  (IFS cloud cover)   (high/mid/low)   (atomic writes)   (IR-like cloud tiles)
```

- **US data source:** NCEP MRMS MultiSensor/3DReflectivity quality-controlled mosaics (default) — QC'd multi-radar composite with 2-min cadence, includes Canadian radar ingest. Falls back to IEM NEXRAD N0Q if MRMS is unavailable (configurable via `LIBREWXR_NA_SOURCE`)
- **Canada data source:** ECCC MSC GeoMet WMS — pre-colored PNG precipitation composite, decoded via palette reverse-engineering back to dBZ. MRMS blending fills gaps in northern Canada and the Atlantic coast when `LIBREWXR_NA_SOURCE=mrms_fallback`
- **Europe data source:** EUMETNET OPERA CIRRUS composite via MeteoGate S3 — ODIM HDF5, 3800×4400 at 1km (LAEA projection), ~155 radars across 24 countries
- **ECMWF IFS global fallback:** ECMWF IFS at native 9km resolution via [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) S3 — precipitation rate converted to pseudo-reflectivity via Marshall-Palmer Z-R relationship, with direct snow/rain classification from snowfall ratio. Hourly IFS frames are interpolated to 10-minute steps via OpenCV Farneback optical flow, so fallback areas animate smoothly. Skips redundant downloads when the IFS model run hasn't changed
- **IFS-derived satellite:** Cloud cover (high/mid/low) from the same IFS data, composited into IR-like satellite tiles. Persistent disk cache with atomic writes survives restarts; backfills from previous model runs to provide continuous past coverage
- **Memory-mapped storage:** Radar frames, ECMWF grids, and nowcast data use numpy memmap backed by temp files. The OS page cache manages physical RAM — pages are reclaimed under pressure and re-faulted on access, reducing heap usage by ~1 GB
- **Tile rendering:** On-demand with LRU caching. Web Mercator reprojection via pure numpy (no GDAL required)
- **Tile warming:** Background thread pool pre-renders tiles for all timestamps when a new tile position is requested, ensuring smooth animation playback
- **No external dependencies beyond pip** — no GDAL, rasterio, or system geo libraries needed

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains two self-contained HTML files showcasing the full LibreWXR feature set:

- **`leaflet.html`** — Leaflet-based weather map
- **`maplibre.html`** — MapLibre GL JS-based weather map

Both examples include:
- **Source selector** — switch between local (`localhost:8080`) and the public instance (`api.librewxr.net`) with auto-detection
- **Layer modes** — Radar, Satellite, or Radar + Satellite (satellite as background under radar)
- **Light/dark theme** — toggles both the base map and UI styling
- **Color scheme selector** — all 10 color schemes
- **Motion arrows** — off, light, or dark
- **Scrubber bar** — draggable timeline with past/nowcast visual distinction and tick labels
- **Background preloading** — pre-renders all frames with a progress indicator for smooth animation
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Space to play/pause, arrow keys to step through frames
- **Locate Me** — geolocate and zoom to your position
- **Auto-refresh** — metadata refreshes every 5 minutes to stay current

Open either file in a browser — it auto-detects whether to use your local server or the public instance based on how the file is loaded.

## Data Sources

LibreWXR uses the following freely available data:

- **[NCEP MRMS](https://www.ncep.noaa.gov/products/mrms/)** — MultiSensor Reanalysis/3DReflectivity quality-controlled radar composites (US + Canadian radar ingest, default source for North American regions)
- **[Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM)](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/)** — NEXRAD N0Q composite radar imagery (US regions, legacy fallback for MRMS)
- **[ECCC MSC GeoMet](https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/msc-geomet/readme_en/)** — Canadian weather radar composite (RADAR_1KM_RRAI via WMS)
- **[EUMETNET OPERA](https://www.eumetnet.eu/activities/observations-programme/current-activities/opera/)** — Pan-European CIRRUS radar composite via [MeteoGate](https://meteogate.eu/) S3 (~155 radars, 24 countries, ODIM HDF5)
- **[ECMWF IFS](https://www.ecmwf.int/) via [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)** — ECMWF IFS 9km global precipitation and snowfall data for worldwide fallback coverage and snow/rain classification (CC-BY-4.0, data provided by Open-Meteo.com)

All sources are provided by government-funded institutions and are freely available for any use. ECMWF IFS data is provided by Open-Meteo under the [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

## Current Limitations

- **Limited high-resolution coverage** — real radar composites cover the US (CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam), Canada, and Europe (via OPERA); the rest of the world uses ECMWF IFS 9km precipitation data as a fallback
- **Experimental nowcasting** — precipitation nowcast uses optical flow extrapolation blended with ECMWF IFS, which works well for steady, organized precipitation but is less reliable for fast-developing convection, cell initiation/dissipation, or complex terrain effects
- **Satellite is IFS-derived, not real imagery** — the satellite layer composites ECMWF IFS cloud cover fields rather than using actual satellite observations, so it reflects model output rather than real-time conditions. Update cadence is hourly (matching IFS), not the ~15-minute cadence of real geostationary satellites
