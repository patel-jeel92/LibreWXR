"""Smoke tests for the standalone data-pipeline entry point.

We don't exercise the full fetch loop here — that touches real network
endpoints and is covered by the per-source integration tests.  The
goals are:

1. ``run_pipeline`` errors out loudly when ``LIBREWXR_CACHE_DIR`` is
   unset (the multi-worker split is meaningless without a shared dir).
2. The module imports without dragging in FastAPI / uvicorn.
3. A minimal pipeline can be wired up far enough to dump a state.json
   snapshot and shut down cleanly when SIGTERM arrives.
