# Adding a New Source

This guide walks through adding a radar composite or regional NWP grid to LibreWXR. By the end, your source will be auto-discovered at startup, dispatched to by `RadarFetcher`, blended into the NWP chain, contribute to the coverage map, and need zero edits to `data/fetcher.py`, `data/regions.py`, or `data/coverage.py`.

If you're looking for the short procedural checklist instead of the full walkthrough, see the **"Adding a New Source"** section in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) at the project root.

Self-hosters running their own LibreWXR instance are free to integrate any source the architecture supports — that's between the operator and the upstream data provider. **Contributing a source to the core project is narrower:** the data has to be open, either by explicit license or by a clear governmental policy that places it in the open. Read [Upstream contribution criteria](#upstream-contribution-criteria) before doing the implementation work, especially if the licensing situation isn't already obvious.

## Upstream contribution criteria

LibreWXR is permissive about what you run on your own instance. Submitting a source for inclusion in the upstream project is narrower — it has to be redistributable by an AGPL-3.0 open-source project that anyone can host.

### Hard requirements

A source can be merged upstream when **all three** of the following hold:

- **Open license, or a site-wide open-data policy that plausibly covers it.** An explicit license is the easiest case — e.g., CC-BY-4.0 (MMD Malaysia), Etalab Open Licence v2.0 (Météo-France), OGDL v1.0 (CWA Taiwan), Canada OGL, US public domain. "Heavily implied" also counts when the operator publishes a clear blanket policy: e.g., a national meteorology site stating that unless marked otherwise, all data and information on the site is in the public domain. PAGASA (Philippines) is one example of that shape — site-wide public-domain notice covering products that lack their own per-product license text.
- **Anonymous access.** No API keys, no per-user tokens, no registration. API-key-gated sources are an automatic decline for the core project regardless of how generous the license is, because they don't scale to a self-hosted project where every operator would need to register their own credentials.
- **Redistribution permitted.** No "non-commercial only" clauses, no "no third-party hosting" clauses, no audience restrictions. LibreWXR does not put a ceiling on who can run it, and bundling sources whose terms exclude commercial or large-scale operators would create asymmetric licensing across the source set.

### Soft constraints (Tier 2)

These are accepted but worth flagging in the package `README.md`:

- WAFs / Cloudflare / Imperva in front of the source — tolerated when anonymous access works reliably in practice.
- Undocumented bounds or projection — workable when reverse-engineering is unambiguous and verifiable against the operator's own viewer at the same wall-clock moment.
- Attribution requirements — fine as long as they can be honored in the package `README.md` (and, if required by the license, in the served UI).
- Short archive depth (under 24 hours) — acceptable; note it in the README.

### Blockers

These rule a source out for upstream regardless of how technically attractive it is:

- API keys or per-user authentication.
- "Non-commercial use only" / "no redistribution" / "personal use only" terms.
- App-only access policies (operator's stated position is that the data is for their own apps, not third-party use).
- Paywalls, even nominal ones.
- Commercial state-owned-enterprise licensing (national met service that operates as a commercial entity and licenses data per customer).

### When the license is unclear

Reach out to the operator before doing the implementation work. Ask plainly whether the data is available for redistribution by a self-hostable, AGPL-3.0 open-source project. If the answer is no or ambiguous, record the determination in [`source-survey.md`](source-survey.md) — that file is the running ledger of accept / defer / reject decisions across radar and NWP sources, and is the right place to save the next contributor from re-discovering a blocker.

## How discovery works

At startup, `librewxr.sources.__init__` calls `pkgutil.walk_packages()` over the `sources/` tree, imports every subpackage, and collects two kinds of provider functions defined at the package level:

- `radar_provider(settings) -> RadarSourceContribution | None`
- `nwp_provider(settings, cache_dir) -> NWPContribution | None`

A provider returns `None` when its config flag is off — that's how a source opts out cleanly. The fetcher loops over `RADAR_PROVIDERS` and `NWP_PROVIDERS`, calls each one, and wires up only the contributions that returned non-`None`.

Side-effect: **adding a directory under `sources/` with a `radar_provider` or `nwp_provider` in its `__init__.py` is the entire registration step.** No central list to update.

## Directory layout

Every source is a self-contained Python package:

```
sources/
  world/                              # global sources
    ifs/
      __init__.py                     # provider
      grid.py                         # implementation
      interpolation.py                # source-specific helpers
      README.md                       # operator notes
  regional/
    <continent>/
      <country>/                      # only when the data is dominantly one country's
        radar/<source_name>/
          __init__.py
          source.py
          regions.py
          stations.py
          README.md
        nwp/<source_name>/
          __init__.py
          grid.py
          README.md
```

`__init__.py` is the only mandatory file the discovery walker looks at; everything else is convention so contributors land in predictable places.

### Country-dir convention

Use a country directory when the data is dominantly that country's (MRMS for the US, MMD for Malaysia, HRDPS for Canada). **Skip** the country directory when the data is genuinely multi-country (OPERA covers 30+ European countries; AROME Antilles covers Guadeloupe + Martinique + French Guiana; WRF-SMN covers six countries in the Southern Cone).

| Source       | Has country dir? | Why                                          |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| MRMS (US)    | yes (`usa/`)     | NEXRAD-only network, single operator         |
| OPERA        | no               | EUMETNET, ~30 countries pooled               |
| HRDPS        | yes (`canada/`)  | ECCC's national model                        |
| AROME Antilles | no             | Multi-territory                              |
| WRF-SMN      | no               | AR+CL+UY+PY+BO+S.BR                          |
| MMD          | yes (`malaysia/`)| MET Malaysia, single operator                |
| ICON-EU      | no               | DWD-operated but EU-wide footprint           |

## Adding a radar source

Walk through with a hypothetical "ZQR Zorbia Composite" (single-country, single-region, ~150 km coverage).

### `regions.py`

Define one or more `RegionDef`s and expose them as a list plus a `REGION_GROUP` string. The discovery walker reads these from the package's `__init__.py` to populate the global `REGIONS` dict and `REGION_GROUPS` map.

```python
# sources/regional/.../zorbia/radar/zqr/regions.py
from librewxr.data.regions import RegionDef

ZQRCOMP = RegionDef(
    name="ZQRCOMP",
    west=12.0, east=22.0,
    south=-5.0, north=5.0,
    pixel_size=0.01,
    group="ZORBIA",
)

REGIONS = [ZQRCOMP]
```

`RegionDef` supports `proj="latlon"` (default), `proj="lcc"`, `proj="stere"`, and `proj="laea"`. When you need a projected grid, populate the relevant `grid_*` / `laea_*` / projection fields — see `OPERA` in `sources/regional/europe/radar/opera/regions.py` for an LAEA worked example.

### `stations.py`

This drives the coverage-mask builder. Two exports:

- `STATION_MAP: dict[str, list[tuple[float, float]]]` — one entry per region, each value a list of `(lat, lon)` for the contributing radars.
- `RANGE_OVERRIDES: dict[str, float]` — optional. Effective km range for each region. Regions missing here use the 240 km default Doppler reach.

```python
# sources/regional/.../zorbia/radar/zqr/stations.py
STATIONS = [
    (0.5,  15.2),    # ZQR-01 Lagos Central
    (-2.1, 18.7),    # ZQR-02 South Plateau
]

STATION_MAP = {"ZQRCOMP": STATIONS}
RANGE_OVERRIDES = {"ZQRCOMP": 150.0}  # operator publishes 150 km product
```

A range override is justified when the upstream publishes a non-standard footprint (OPERA's C-band at 300 km, El Salvador's 120 km product, CWA Taiwan's 450 km typhoon buffer, MET Malaysia's 350-375 km CAPPI). Drop the entry if 240 km is correct — don't repeat the default.

### `source.py`

The source class implements an async `fetch_frame(region) -> (datetime, np.ndarray) | None`, an `fetch_archive_frame(region, when)`, and a `close()`. The returned ndarray is `uint8` dBZ-encoded — use the canonical encoder in `librewxr.sources._helpers`:

```python
# sources/regional/.../zorbia/radar/zqr/source.py
from librewxr.sources._helpers import _dbz_float_to_uint8

class ZQRSource:
    def __init__(self, base_url: str):
        self._client = httpx.AsyncClient(base_url=base_url)

    async def fetch_frame(self, region):
        ...  # fetch + decode native format → float32 dBZ
        return timestamp, _dbz_float_to_uint8(dbz_floats)

    async def fetch_archive_frame(self, region, when):
        ...

    async def close(self):
        await self._client.aclose()
```

If the upstream is GRIB2-based, wrap the cfgrib call in `_suppress_eccodes_stderr()` from `_helpers` to muzzle the library's non-actionable `dataTime` warnings.

### `__init__.py` (the provider)

This file is the public face of the package. It exports `REGIONS`, `REGION_GROUP`, the source class, and the `radar_provider` function the discovery walker calls.

```python
# sources/regional/.../zorbia/radar/zqr/__init__.py
from librewxr.sources._base import RadarSourceContribution

from .regions import REGIONS, ZQRCOMP
from .source import ZQRSource
from .stations import RANGE_OVERRIDES, STATION_MAP

REGION_GROUP = "ZORBIA"

__all__ = ["REGIONS", "REGION_GROUP", "ZQRCOMP", "ZQRSource", "radar_provider"]


def radar_provider(settings) -> RadarSourceContribution | None:
    if not getattr(settings, "zqr_enabled", True):
        return None
    instance = ZQRSource(settings.zqr_base_url)
    return RadarSourceContribution(
        regions=list(REGIONS),
        instance=instance,
        group=REGION_GROUP,
        station_map={k: list(v) for k, v in STATION_MAP.items()},
        range_overrides=dict(RANGE_OVERRIDES),
    )
```

A few things to note:

- The `getattr(settings, "zqr_enabled", True)` pattern lets the discovery walker run even if config setting isn't defined yet (e.g. during a partial migration). It also encodes the project convention: **new sources default to enabled** (see `feedback_models_enabled_by_default` in your memory if you have one).
- `RadarSourceContribution.preempts` exists for cross-source policy hints, currently unused — MRMS-vs-IEM dispatch lives in `data/fetcher.py` rather than being expressed declaratively. If you're adding a source that contests a region with an existing source, talk to the maintainer.
- The `regions=` field is the list of `RegionDef` objects the source can fetch frames for. The fetcher only wires the source to regions the user actually enabled via `LIBREWXR_ENABLED_REGIONS`.

## Adding a regional NWP grid

NWP sources are simpler — single file (`grid.py`) plus the provider in `__init__.py`. No regions, no stations.

### `grid.py`

Your `*Grid` class must satisfy the `NWPSource` Protocol in `data/nwp_source.py`:

- `name: str` (used in logs)
- `sample(lat, lon, timestamp, bilinear) -> uint8 dBZ-encoded ndarray`
- `supports_snow: bool` and `get_snow_mask(lat, lon, timestamp) -> bool ndarray`
- `domain_mask(lat, lon) -> bool ndarray` — where the grid has coverage
- `feather_mask(lat, lon) -> float32 ndarray in [0, 1]` — soft taper at the boundary
- `has_data_at(timestamp) -> bool` / `has_data() -> bool`
- `async close() -> None`

For the shared `compute_snow_mask` helper (used by every regional NWP that supports snow), import from HRRR:

```python
from librewxr.sources.regional.north_america.usa.nwp.hrrr.grid import compute_snow_mask
```

HRRR was the original implementation so it owns the helper. DINI, ICON-EU, WRF-SMN, and HRRR-Alaska all import it from this same location.

Interpolation helpers: if your source publishes at a coarser cadence than LibreWXR's 10-min stored interval, use the shared optical-flow interpolator in `data/nwp_interpolation.py`:

```python
from librewxr.data.nwp_interpolation import interpolate_run
```

IFS is the exception — its interpolation lives next door in `sources/world/ifs/interpolation.py` because it was the first one written and the design is IFS-shaped. The shared `nwp_interpolation` module came later when DINI / ICON-EU / WRF-SMN needed it.

### `__init__.py` (the provider)

```python
# sources/regional/.../zorbia/nwp/zqr_wrf/__init__.py
from librewxr.sources._base import NWPContribution

from .grid import ZQRWRFGrid

__all__ = ["ZQRWRFGrid", "nwp_provider"]


def nwp_provider(settings, cache_dir) -> NWPContribution | None:
    if not getattr(settings, "zqr_wrf_enabled", False):
        return None
    return NWPContribution(
        instance=ZQRWRFGrid(cache_dir=cache_dir),
        priority=35,
        name="ZQR-WRF",
    )
```

The `name` doubles as the source's identity in `/health` and in the
cross-process snapshot — it's auto-slugged to a key like
`zqr_wrf_grid` (lowercase, non-word chars → `_`, plus `_grid`). If
your display name doesn't slug cleanly (non-ASCII characters,
abbreviations like "NCaled" for "Nouvelle-Calédonie"), pass an
explicit `slug="…_grid"` field so the snapshot key stays stable:

```python
return NWPContribution(
    instance=ZQRWRFGrid(cache_dir=cache_dir),
    priority=35,
    name="ZQR-WRF Réunion",       # non-ASCII; auto-slug would mangle the é
    slug="zqr_wrf_reunion_grid",  # explicit key for /health + state.json
)
```

The fetcher dispatch in `data/fetcher.py` calls every grid's `fetch()`
under a shared semaphore. It uses `inspect.signature` to decide whether
to pass `history_seconds` and `horizon_seconds` — if your grid's
`fetch()` accepts those kwargs (the common case), they're passed; if
it takes no kwargs (like IFS), nothing is passed. No registration step
is needed for either shape.

### Priority numbers

`priority` controls position in the `NWPChain`: **lower numbers run first**, so narrower / higher-resolution domains should pick smaller numbers. The chain dispatcher fills pixels from the first source whose `feather_mask` is positive, falling through to the next source where the previous one's feather is zero.

Current assignments:

| Source                   | Priority | Notes                                              |
|--------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| HRRR                     | 10       | 3 km CONUS, narrowest domain                       |
| HRRR-Alaska              | 11       | Same model, disjoint domain                        |
| HRDPS                    | 20       | 2.5 km Canada                                      |
| AROME Antilles           | 25       | 2.5 km Caribbean (FR-GP + MQ)                      |
| AROME Guyane             | 26       | 2.5 km French Guiana                               |
| AROME Indien             | 27       | 2.5 km SW Indian Ocean (RE + YT + KM + MG + SW)    |
| AROME Nouvelle-Calédonie | 28       | 2.5 km SW Pacific (NC + VU)                        |
| AROME Polynésie          | 29       | 2.5 km French Polynesia                            |
| DMI DINI                 | 30       | 2 km Nordic / NW Europe                            |
| ICON-EU                  | 35       | 7 km Europe (catches what DMI DINI doesn't)        |
| WRF-SMN                  | 40       | 4 km Southern Cone                                 |
| **IFS**                  | **1000** | Global catch-all                                   |

Pick a number that places your source in the right spot. If your source's domain is disjoint from every other regional, the exact number between 10 and 999 doesn't matter behaviorally — just keep it deterministic and self-documenting. If your source overlaps another regional, put it before or after based on which should win inside the overlap.

## Config additions

The Pydantic `Settings` class in `src/librewxr/config.py` is the single source of truth for all `LIBREWXR_*` env vars. Add your source's settings alongside the existing ones:

```python
# config.py
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    ...
    zqr_enabled: bool = True             # default-enabled per project convention
    zqr_base_url: str = "https://radar.zorbia.example/composite/"
```

Then add the same line to `.env.example` with a brief comment so users discover the knob. The full reference (`docs/configuration-reference.md`) is where you'd document the setting in detail.

## Coverage map

Add the new station footprint to `scripts/generate_coverage_map.py`:

```python
# in build_radar_sources():
for poly in union_of_radar_circles(ZQR_STATIONS, range_for("ZQRCOMP")):
    radar.append(Source("ZQR Composite (Zorbia)", "#ff7f0e", poly))
```

Import the station list and any range override directly from your new `stations.py`:

```python
from librewxr.sources.regional.<...>.radar.zqr.stations import (
    RANGE_OVERRIDES as ZQR_RANGES,
    STATIONS as ZQR_STATIONS,
)
# then merge ZQR_RANGES into REGION_RADAR_RANGE at the top of the script
```

Regenerate the PNGs (the script header documents the throwaway-venv recipe):

```bash
python scripts/generate_coverage_map.py
```

Commit both updated PNGs (`docs/coverage-map-radar.png` and `docs/coverage-map-models.png`) alongside your code change.

## Tests

Add a `tests/test_<source>.py` for your source. Mark it appropriately:

```python
import pytest
pytestmark = pytest.mark.sources  # or pytest.mark.nwp for grids
```

Look at `tests/test_cwa.py` (smallest radar test) or `tests/test_arome_antilles_grid.py` (smallest NWP test) for the smallest viable shape. Mock HTTP with `httpx.MockTransport` or the project's existing fixtures — don't hit the network in unit tests.

If the registry-discovery tests in `tests/test_sources_discovery.py` need an assertion for your new source (e.g. that it shows up in the chain or in `RADAR_PROVIDERS`), add it there.

## Final checklist

Before opening a PR:

- [ ] License + redistribution terms verified compatible with [Upstream contribution criteria](#upstream-contribution-criteria).
- [ ] Package directory exists under the right `sources/.../` path (follow the country-dir convention).
- [ ] `__init__.py` exports a `radar_provider` or `nwp_provider`.
- [ ] `regions.py` (radar) defines `REGIONS` and `REGION_GROUP`.
- [ ] `stations.py` (radar) defines `STATION_MAP` and (optionally) `RANGE_OVERRIDES`.
- [ ] New config knobs added to `config.py` and `.env.example`, defaulting to enabled.
- [ ] License + attribution documented in the package's `README.md` (every existing source has one — copy the shape).
- [ ] `scripts/generate_coverage_map.py` updated; both coverage PNGs regenerated.
- [ ] `pytest` clean.
- [ ] Smoke-run the server (`python -m librewxr.main`) once and confirm the new source shows up in the startup logs.

That's it — no `data/fetcher.py`, `data/regions.py`, or `data/coverage.py` edits required. The discovery walker handles registration and the providers do the rest.
