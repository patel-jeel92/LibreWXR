"""Counts tile requests above a zoom threshold to surface usage hotspots.

Purely observational: a future adaptive-warming pass can read the same
counters to decide which tiles to keep warm, but this module never
schedules work itself. Designed to be cheap on the hot path — a dict
update under a Lock — so it can sit inline in the tile endpoint.

State is in-memory only; restarts wipe the counters. That's fine for
the diagnostic phase: we just want a few days of distribution to see
whether traffic is power-law (a few hot tiles) or diffuse.
