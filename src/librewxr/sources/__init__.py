"""Source registry — auto-discovers radar and NWP source packages.

Each source lives as a self-contained subpackage under one of:

    librewxr.sources.world.<source>            # global sources (e.g. IFS)
    librewxr.sources.regional.<region>.<...>.<source>

A source package's ``__init__.py`` exposes one of these provider
functions:

    def radar_provider(settings) -> RadarSourceContribution | None: ...
    def nwp_provider(settings, cache_dir) -> NWPContribution | None: ...

Returning ``None`` means "disabled / not configured" — the source is
skipped silently.

At import time we walk every subpackage and collect the provider
functions into ``RADAR_PROVIDERS`` and ``NWP_PROVIDERS``.  ``fetcher.py``
and ``main.py`` call those at startup to build the actual source map
and NWP chain.

Phase 0 (2026-05-17): scaffolding only.  No source packages have been
migrated yet, so both lists are empty in practice — the wiring below
is exercised by the registry tests but produces no runtime behavior.
