"""ECMWF IFS — self-contained NWP source package.

Global 9 km precipitation grid from Open-Meteo's S3 mirror.  Lowest
priority in the NWP chain (highest numeric ``priority``) so it always
runs after every regional source — its job is to catch everywhere the
regionals don't cover.  Also feeds the cloud-cover layer and the
snow/rain classification fallback when no regional source supports
snow at a given pixel.
