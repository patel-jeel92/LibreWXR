"""ECCC Canadian weather radar network.

32 S-band dual-pol stations (METEOR 1700S) operated by Environment and
Climate Change Canada after the 2023 network modernization.  Coordinates
from the Canadian Weather Radar Network Wikipedia article,
cross-referenced with ECCC station pages.

Needed because MSC's RADAR_1KM_RRAI composite covers the whole CACOMP
bbox but only has actual data within ~240 km of these stations —
without a mask, the ECMWF fallback is suppressed over huge empty
regions (open Pacific, Arctic, Atlantic).
