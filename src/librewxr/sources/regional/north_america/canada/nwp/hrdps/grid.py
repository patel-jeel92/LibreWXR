"""ECCC HRDPS continental high-resolution precipitation source.

Implements the NWPSource Protocol for Environment and Climate Change
Canada's High-Resolution Deterministic Prediction System — a 2.5 km
native rotated-lat/lon HARMONIE-style configuration covering Canada,
the Canadian Arctic, and the northern fringe of CONUS (roughly 27°N–84°N
and 172°W–10°W in geographic coordinates).

Four daily cycles (00/06/12/18 UTC), 48 h forecast horizon, hourly
forecast steps.  HRDPS does not publish a composite reflectivity field;
we derive dBZ from the ``APCP-Accum1h_Sfc`` variable (1-hour windowed
precipitation accumulation in kg/m² ≡ mm) by applying the same
Marshall-Palmer Z-R conversion ECMWFGrid / ICONEUGrid / DMIDiniGrid use.
Unlike DMI DINI we do NOT difference consecutive forecast steps —
``APCP-Accum1h_Sfc`` is already a 1-hour window, not a run-anchored
cumulant — so the value at lead H is directly the precip rate over the
hour ending at H.

Distribution: anonymous Environment Canada / MSC dd.weather.gc.ca
HTTPS.  Each (run, lead) is a single GRIB2 message ~150 KB-1.5 MB
containing one variable / one level / one forecast hour, so we fetch
the whole file every time — no .idx sidecar, no byte-range header walk.

Projection: ECCC migrated HRDPS from polar-stereographic to rotated
lat/lon (RLatLon) in November 2023; pre-2023 example code is wrong.
The grid's "north pole" sits at geographic (36.08852°N, 65.30514°E),
with 0° rotation about the new pole axis.  We hand-roll the forward
transform per the COSMO/WMO ``gridType: rotated_ll`` convention —
geographic → rotated, two trig identities, no pyproj dependency.
