"""Protocols and contribution dataclasses for the sources registry.

Each source package under ``librewxr.sources`` exports a provider
function (``radar_provider`` or ``nwp_provider``) returning one of the
contribution dataclasses below.  The discovery walker in
``librewxr.sources.__init__`` collects those providers; ``fetcher.py``
and ``main.py`` call them to assemble the actual radar source map and
NWP chain at startup.

Source-specific config still lives in ``librewxr.config.settings`` and
is passed into each provider — Phase 0 of the refactor (2026-05-17)
deliberately kept config centralized to avoid Pydantic gymnastics.

    External nowcast sources publish forecast-leg frames for a specific

    directly rather than computing via internal optical-flow.  Use this
    when an upstream agency publishes a higher-quality nowcast than our
    generic extrapolation could produce (e.g. JMA HRPN which fuses
    XRAIN, models convective cell growth, and maintains gauge mass
    balance through the forecast horizon).

      - boundary feathering at the contribution's coverage edge,
        where the external nowcast hands off to optical-flow extrapolation
      - blend weight against the radar analysis at T=0
      - snow-mask overlay if applicable

    covering one update cycle's forecast frames (typically 5-min steps

    ``station_map`` is keyed by region name and feeds the coverage-mask
    builder in ``data/coverage.py``.  Regions without a station list and
    without a coverage polygon get no explicit mask (full-region bbox
    coverage is assumed by ``sample_coverage``).  ``range_overrides``
    likewise feeds the mask builder — any region missing here uses the
    240 km default Doppler reach.

    ``coverage_polygons`` is the alternative for gauge-corrected QPE
    composites whose published extent doesn't match individual Doppler
    ranges (JMA HRPN's tile pyramid traces a tilted polygon along the
    archipelago; OPERA, MRMS would qualify too).  When a region appears
    here, its mask is built from the polygon and the station-circle
    path is skipped.  Vertices are (latitude, longitude) tuples in
    polygon order — winding direction doesn't matter (the fill is
    rasterised either way).  Each region's value is either a single
