"""Protocols and contribution dataclasses for the sources registry.

Each source package under ``librewxr.sources`` exports a provider
function (``radar_provider`` or ``nwp_provider``) returning one of the
contribution dataclasses below.  The discovery walker in
``librewxr.sources.__init__`` collects those providers; ``fetcher.py``
and ``main.py`` call them to assemble the actual radar source map and
NWP chain at startup.

Source-specific config still lives in ``librewxr.config.settings`` and
is passed into each provider — Phase 0 of the refactor (2026-05-17)
deliberately kept config centralized to avoid Pydantic gymnastics.
