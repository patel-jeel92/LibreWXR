"""Optical-flow temporal interpolation for ECMWF IFS hourly grids.

Generates synthetic sub-hourly frames by computing motion vectors between
consecutive IFS hours and warping precipitation fields along those vectors.
This makes global fallback areas animate smoothly at the same ~10-minute
cadence as radar data, instead of jumping hour-to-hour.

Uses OpenCV's Farneback dense optical flow, computed at reduced resolution
for speed, then upscaled for full-resolution warping.
