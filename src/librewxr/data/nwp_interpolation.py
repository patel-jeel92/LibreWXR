"""Generic optical-flow temporal interpolation for NWP grids.

Used by both the global ECMWF IFS path (which sees one continuous
timeline of unix timestamps) and the regional NWP sources that
interpolate within a single model run (lead_seconds-keyed).  The
helper is projection-agnostic and grid-shape-agnostic — it just
needs frames keyed by sortable integers in consistent units and a
target interval to fill in.

Uses OpenCV's Farneback dense optical flow, computed at reduced
resolution for speed, then upscaled for full-resolution warping.
The same machinery handles both precipitation (uint8 dBZ-encoded)
and snow-mask (uint8 0/1) fields.

Historical note: this code was extracted from the IFS-specific
``ecmwf_interpolation.py`` so the regional NWP sources can share
the warp pipeline.  The original module is now a thin wrapper that
adapts the IFS ``(precip, snow)`` tuple-dict format to this
helper's parallel-dict signature.

    For each consecutive pair of source frames whose gap exceeds the

    preserved unchanged.  Idempotent: if the timeline already has

            synthetic keys.
        target_interval_seconds: The desired stored interval between
            frames.  Pairs with gap ≤ this value are skipped (no work).
        downscale: Resolution factor for the Farneback compute pass.
            Higher = faster but coarser flow.  4 has worked well from
