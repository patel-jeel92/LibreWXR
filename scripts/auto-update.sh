# LibreWXR auto-update helper.
#
# Checks the tracked branch for new commits and, if any exist, pulls them
# and rebuilds the running docker compose stack. Safe to run from cron or
# a systemd timer — exits quietly when there is nothing to do, uses an
# flock to prevent concurrent runs, and refuses to touch a dirty working
# tree.
#
# Safety: this script is a no-op unless the host explicitly opts in by
# creating a sentinel file at ${REPO_DIR}/.auto-update-enabled (or by
# setting LIBREWXR_AUTO_UPDATE=1 in the environment). The sentinel is in
# .gitignore so cloning the repo on your development machine will *not*
# enable auto-updates — you have to `touch .auto-update-enabled` on the
# production host you actually want to run this on.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/auto-update.sh              # run once (requires opt-in)
#   scripts/auto-update.sh --dry-run    # check for updates without applying
#                                       # (safe, runs without opt-in)
#   scripts/auto-update.sh --env        # reconcile .env with .env.example
#                                       # (no git pull, no rebuild)
#   scripts/auto-update.sh --build      # rebuild and restart the stack
#                                       # (no git pull, no env sync)
#
# --env and --build are manual-invocation flags and bypass the opt-in
# sentinel — they only do what you explicitly asked for and won't pull
# code from upstream. They still respect the concurrent-run flock so
# they can't race with a cron-driven full update.
#
# Enable on a production host:
#   touch /path/to/LibreWXR/.auto-update-enabled
#
# Cron example (hourly, logging to /var/log/librewxr-update.log):
#   0 * * * * /path/to/LibreWXR/scripts/auto-update.sh \
#             >> /var/log/librewxr-update.log 2>&1
#
# Note: if you need to customise docker-compose.yml (e.g. memory limits),
# set the corresponding LIBREWXR_* variables in .env instead of editing
# the file directly — the auto-updater refuses to run on a dirty working
# tree, and .env is already in .gitignore.
#
# After a successful pull, the script also reconciles your .env against
# .env.example: any LIBREWXR_* variables that have appeared upstream but
# are missing locally get appended (with their default value and the
# explanatory comments from .env.example) so you don't have to manually
# track new settings between releases. Existing values are never touched,
# and a backup is written to .env.bak before any modification. Set
# LIBREWXR_AUTO_ENV_SYNC=0 to disable this step.
